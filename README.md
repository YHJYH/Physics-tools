# Physics-tools
I have written some computational tools for calculation in particle physics.<br>
Includes:<br>

cross section.cpp is used to calculate cross section for Z boson to two-lepton reaction in proton-proton collision in ATLAS experiment. Specifically, they are Z to ee and Z to mumu. Parameters in .cpp file need to be modified when use.<br>
transition energy.cpp is a program to calculate transition energy using simple Bohr formula.<br>
