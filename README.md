# Physics-tools
I have written some great computational tools for theoretical physics calculation.<br>
Includes:<br>

cross section.cpp is used to calculate cross section for Z boson to two-lepton reaction in proton-proton collision in ATLAS experiment. Specifically, they are Z to ee and Z to mumu. Parameters in .cpp file need to be modified when use.

transition energy.cpp is a program to calculate transition energy using simple Bohr formula.
