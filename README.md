# Physics-tools
I have written some computational tools for calculation in particle physics.<br>
Includes:<br>

<b>cross section.cpp</b> is used to calculate cross section for Z boson to two-lepton reaction in proton-proton collision in ATLAS experiment. Specifically, they are Z to ee and Z to mumu. Parameters in .cpp file need to be modified when use.<br><br>
<b>transition energy.cpp</b> is a program to calculate transition energy using simple Bohr formula.<br>
